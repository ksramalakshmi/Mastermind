INSTRUCTIONS:
At each turn, the player chooses a combination of coloured pegs.
The computer returns one black dot for each peg on the right position. One white dot for each peg is returned if the combination is in a different position. 
Then the player chooses a different combination, adding pegs of other colours, switching the order of the coloured pegs, or both. 
The game continues until the combination is found or the maximum number of turns is reached.
